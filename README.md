## Goal

Get to the end of "The Road" Obscure the line of sight between "Us" and "Them"

## Controlls
WASD to move 

## Detailing

Loose Perspective from above looking down & Forward
You cannot look backward DIE
A infinit road with long buildings 
Materials are gathered from the buildings
When you're done walk down the road and go to the right and you'll get home
The walk is long and lonely; you've met people looking back
